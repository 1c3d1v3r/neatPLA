PLA replacement circuit for Commodore 64.
Based on dodgyPLA https://github.com/desaster/c64-dodgypla

I showed the design to some friends and they said "neat". Hence the name neatPLA :)

What is changed compared to dodgyPLA:
- 3.6V voltage regulator. Better for logic levels. Still within XC9536XL specs
- Cool looking PCB
- Changed pin mapping code to mach the new schematic & PCB.
- CASRAM delay increased to 30ns. Fixes timing issues with motherboard 326298
- Added extra delay to all outputs. Fixes a timing issue with motherboard 250425 + SwinSID

Now it is one of the most compatible PLA replacements.

This project includes:
* A Xilinx ISE project written in Verilog for Xilinx XC9536XL
* A Xilinx iMPACT project file (I use this SW and Xilinx Platform cable USB for programming)
* .jed and .svf file for programming the CPLD chip (subfolder _original_dodgyPLA_fix_ got fixed files for the original dodgyPLA and compatible versions)
* Gerber design files for ordering your own PCBs
* BOM and CPL files for SMD assembly service
* Schematic PDF

Long leg female headers makes a lower profile but are only compatible with leaf spring sockets. Round pin headers gives a taller profile but are compatible with all sockets.
