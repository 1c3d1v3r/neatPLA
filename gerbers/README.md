R1 gerbers are the original ones released in 2020. R2 gerbers have been edited to match JLCpcb rules.
Holes under top silk have been moved. Teardrops added.
Now also BOM and CPL files are included. You can use them at PCBway or JLCpcb. 
Order with black soldermask. Select "Remove product No." or "Remove mark" as there is no defined place for the order number and manufacturer may place it to top.
